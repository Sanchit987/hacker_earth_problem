 Objective
 In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

 Task
 Given an integer, nn, perform the following conditional actions:

 If nn is odd, print WeirdWeird.
 If nn is even and in the inclusive range of 22 to 55, print Not WeirdNot Weird.
 If nn is even and in the inclusive range of 66 to 2020, print WeirdWeird.
 If nn is even and greater than 2020, print Not WeirdNot Weird.
 Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not nn is weird.

 Input Format

 A single line containing a positive integer, nn.

 Constraints

 1≤n≤1001≤n≤100
 Output Format

 Print WeirdWeird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not WeirdNot Weird.

 Sample Input 0

 3
 Sample Output 0

 Weird
 Sample Input 1

 24
 Sample Output 1

 Not Weird
 Explanation

 Sample Case 0: n=3n=3
 nn is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print WeirdWeird.
 Sample Case 1: n=24n=24
 n>20n>20 and nn is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not WeirdNot Weird.
